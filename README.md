# My Work Portfolio
This repository showcases a variety of geospatial data analytics projects that leverage machine learning and remote sensing techniques. The projects demonstrate practical applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster management.

## Key Projects

### Classification
- Land cover/land use classification using multi-spectral satellite imagery
- Object detection in high-resolution aerial photography
- Time-series classification of vegetation changes

### Crop Mapping
- Automated crop type identification from satellite data
- Crop health assessment and growth stage monitoring
- Yield prediction models using multi-temporal imagery

### Prediction
- Vegetation index forecasting for agricultural planning
- Land use change prediction using historical data
- Crop yield estimation based on environmental variables

### Flood Detection
- Real-time flood extent mapping using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Optical data
- Historical flood pattern analysis
- Flood risk modeling and vulnerability assessment

## Technologies Used
- Python geospatial libraries (GDAL, Rasterio, GeoPandas)
- Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Cloud-based remote sensing platforms (Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer)
- GIS software integration (QGIS, ArcGIS)

## Getting Started
Each project folder contains detailed documentation, code, and example datasets to help users understand and replicate the analyses.
