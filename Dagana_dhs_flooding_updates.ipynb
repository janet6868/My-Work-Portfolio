        "The agricultural sub-sector, particularly smallholder agriculture, is the focal point of the FIS, Local risk control service work stream. Inter-farm variability in management practices among small farms largely determines yield outcomes. Optimizing agronomic practices alone is insufficient for ensuring food security- significantly more inputs are required. The primary challenge lies within the agricultural value chain, particularly concerning access to credit for small farmers, which financial service providers perceive as risky and costly. The objective of this work stream is to develop services that leverage Earth Observation (EO) to mitigate risk perception, thereby facilitating investments in agriculture. These services aim to reduce the costs associated with quantifying risk and value at risk while enabling access to innovative financing options like climate finance. Emphasis will be placed on interventions bridging the agriculture and environmental sectors, particularly within the Agriculture and Food Security and Ecosystem and Carbon Management thematic areas in the SERVIR context. EO-based solutions can revolutionize risk management in agriculture, addressing challenges such as delays in planting due to late credit and input arrivals, which affect harvest quality, sales prices, and overall risk in the agricultural value chain. \n",

        "1. Data acquistion: \n",
        "    - Sentinel-2’s multispectral capabilities are well-suited for land cover and vegetation\n",
        "    analysis. With its wide coverage and high spatial resolution, it provides valuable information for monitoring changes in land cover and vegetation growth\n",
        "    - We use area of interest boundaries to access through Google Earth Engine: RGB, Normalized Difference Water Index(NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the mask cloud layer depending on your current task. \n",
        "    - Clouds are identified from the S2 cloud probability dataset (s2cloudless) and downloaded as cloud images. You can set the probability/percentage of cloud presence in all images between 0 and 100. \n",
        "    - s2cloudless is a machine learning algorithm for computing cloud masks on Sentinel-2 imagery. There is a pre-computed cloud masks for the entire Sentinel-2 archive via the Sentinel Hub service. It assigns each pixel in an image a cloud probability solely based on the pixel’s ten Sentinel-2 band values.\n",
        "    - MNDWI is calculated using the Green band mid infrared bands((Green - SWIR (band 11) ) / (Green + SWIR (band 11))). \n",
        "    - One advantage of MNDWI is that it diminishes built-up areas that are always confused as water bodies compared to NDWI.\n",
        "    - The major limitations of MNDWI: it easily misclassifies shadow and dark roads as water bodies.\n",
        "    - The water bodies appear as bright pixels while dryland appears dark pixels.\n",
        "    - In prepocessing the images before downloading, permanent water is excluded before gnerating the MNDWI tiff.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Extracting the flooded areas: \n",
        "    - Firstly, we generate the flooding map that shows the flooded areas extend.\n",
        "    - The MNDWI values range from -1≤x≤1 and we apply series of logical AND operations to the MNDWI tiff files to identify pixels that represent water bodies (x>0) and that have low cloud cover (y<40).\n",
        "    - The initial MNDWI TIFF file introduced into the workflow is important when extracting flooded areas. Initially, a working array is generated from the RGB TIFF file. Subsequently, using numpy array operations, update this working array with pixel values from the MNDWI TIFFs. Afterwards, assign a value, say 2, to all pixels in the working array where the corresponding pixel values in the first MNDWI TIFF are greater than 0 (indicating water pixels), effectively masking out all pixels where water is present.\n",
        "    - Subsequent MNDWI tiff files' water pixels are then accumulated through a logical process that first verifies if the pixel in the working array is already identified as part of water pixels. This step ensures that pixels flagged in previous iterations are not overwritten.\n",
        "    - The resulting image contains a value of 0 for all non-water pixels, and the day of year for each water pixel.\n",
        "    - Secondly, we extract the convert the water pixels into areas in hectares. Create a proportion of area flooded for each grid cell/plot/point within the area, using a reference RGB image and the shapefile.\n",
        "    - Create a dataframe from the proportion data under flooding for each date.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Estimate the flooding dates\n",
        "    - The aim is to determine the date of the maximum flooding. \n",

        "#### Sentinel 1\n",
        "1. Data acquistion: \n",
        "\n",
        "    - Sentinel-1, operating in C-band, has proven to be a valuable asset for flood monitoring due to its unique capabilities. Its all-weather and day-and-night imaging capacity, coupled with the ability to penetrate through clouds and capture surface changes, makes it ideal for flood detection.\n",
        "    - To ensure data homogeneity, a meticulous filtering process was executed. This process encompassed the selection of data based on specific criteria, including instrument mode (’IW’ for Interferometric Wide Swath), orbit properties (’ASCENDING’ or ’DESCENDING’), and  transmitterreceiver polarizations (’Vertical-Vertical’ (’VV’) and ’Vertical-Horizontal’ (’VH’)). \n",
        "    - Furthermore, the Sentinel-1 data was segregated into distinct polarizations for ’VV,’ ’VH,’ and ’VV/VH’ (ratio) images.\n",
        "    -  The VV band is a good indicator of structural characteristics, such as vegetation density and height, making it useful for crop monitoring. As vegetation matures and its density increases, the VV signal tends to decrease due to increased attenuation caused by the dense canopy.\n",
        "    - Conversely, the VH band is sensitive to surface roughness and moisture content. In the context of rice fields, the VH band can be valuable for flood mapping as it enables the identification of flooded areas. Water bodies, including flooded rice paddies, typically exhibit high VH backscatter due to the specular reflection of radar waves on the smooth water surface.\n",
        "    By comparing the VV/VH ratio, it becomes possible to differentiate between standing crops and harvested or sparse areas. Harvested or sparse areas tend to have higher VV/VH ratios due to reduced vegetation density. Similarly, flooded rice fields exhibit different radar backscatter characteristics compared to non-flooded areas.\n",
        "   - The VV polarization is sensitive to the presence of water, while the VH polarization is influenced by both surface roughness and the presence of water.\n",
        "    - By comparing the VV/VH ratio, flooded areas in rice fields can be identified, marked by higher VV/VH ratios due to increased backscatter from water.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Extracting the flooded areas: \n",
        "\n",
        "    -  Sentinel-1 SAR images are filtered based on instrument mode, orbit properties, and polarization (VV, VH, VV/VH). Then two image collections are defined: \"Before-collection\" for baseline conditions and \"After-collection\" for monitoring changes during and after potential flooding events.\n",
        "    - Flood area detection: Comparison of \"Before\" and \"After\" images to identify changes using a threshold value (1.25) based on statistical properties.\n",

        "    - Fewer red areas suggest better alignment with the planting schedule, possibly due to more favorable conditions or better management.\n",
        "    - More red areas indicate that many plots were either flooded or planted past the SAED window, suggesting potential delays due to various reasons, including delayed financing which affects access to labor and resources.\n",

        "The differences in risk distribution between the two years can help in understanding the changing patterns of flooding and adjusting agricultural practices accordingly.
